never   again   i ' ve   stayed   here   before .    i   guess   i   didn ' t   learn   my   lesson   then .    the   noise   level   is   unbelievable   if   you   are   put   in   a   room   on   the   side   that   runs   along    4  4 th   st .    we   were   on   the    4 th   floor   and   could   not   hear   the   tv   over   the   traffic   and   drunks .    although   the   interior   is   security   gated ,    i   really   did   not   know   if   my   car   was   going   to   be   there   in   the   morning .    the   noise   from   the   surrounding   rooms   was   horrible .    everytime   somebody   slammed   a   door ,    it   made   things   on   the   table   in   our   room   shake .    i   realize   the   hotel   cannot   do   anything   about   the   police   helicopter   noise   while   they   were   searching   by   spotlight   for   somebody   in   our   parking   lot   area ,    but   it   sure   added   to   the   total   ambience   of   the   place .    the   rooms   were   clean   but   worn   down   looking ,    the   bathroom   was   exceptionally   dinky .    the   one   good   thing   i   can   say   about   this   hotel   was   the   front   desk   staff   is   especially   helpful   and   nice .    although ,    the   housekeeping   staff   needs   to   turn   down   the   mariachi   music   while   they   are   cleaning   the   rooms .    i   always   stay   at   hilton   chains ,    but   will   never   return   to   this   one . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
ok   but   needs   renovation   i   was   looking   forward   to   my   first   stay   in   an   embassy   suites   facility .    i   was   part   of   a   convention   contingent   who   had   been   booked   into   the   hotel .    the   neighborhood   is   not   good   and   if   you   do   not   have   a   car ,    you   are   captive   to   the   hotel   without   other   attractions ,    dining ,    etc   within   safe   walking   distance .    the   hotel   seems   to   be   about    5    miles   from   all   attractions    ( down   town ,    scottsdale ,    etc )    except   the   airport ,    which   is   very   close   by . the   lobby   was   nice   and   comfortable   and   the   front   desk   staff   was   pleasant .    while   my   room   was   ready ,    others   in   my   party   waited   hours   for   a   room    ( and   we   arrived   at   about    3  :  3  0    pm )  . the   official   hotel   photos   looked   nice ,    but   the   room   photos   they   showed   must   have   been   somewhere   else   in   the   facility .    the   photos   published   by   other   reviewers   were   like   my   room .    we   had   requested   a   double - double   room   for   three   adults .    we   had   two   beds ,    but   they   were   small   double   beds ,    not   the   queens   appearing   in   official   photos   and   implied   we   would   get .    i   ended   up   sleeping   on   the   sleeper   sofa   so   my   wife   and   son   could   rest   on   a   real   bed .    the   sleeper   sofa   was   like   sleeping   in   a   hammock   without   the   comfort .    it   sagged   terribly   and   the   framework   pressed   very   firmly   across   my   chest   a   hips .    it   was   a   very   uncomfrtable    7    nights .    in   addition ,    i   discovered   the   bedding   had   not   been   changed   prior   to   my   use    -  -    i   ended   up   with   insect   bites   all   over   my   torso   that   i   had   initially   attributed   to   a   reaction   to   a   laundry   detergent . room   service   arrived   at   our   room   around    5    pm   every   day   except   one   while   we   were   there .    none   of   the   maids   spoke   english .    we   had   to   call   housekeeping   to   find   someone   who   spoke   english   and   ask   that   the   bedding   be   changed   on   the   sleeper   sofa .    otherwise ,    the   ladies   did   a   good   job   when   they   finally   got   there . as   written   elsewhere ,    the   rooms   are   severely   in   need   of   renovation    ( which   is   actually   underway )  .    the   bathroom    ( tub   and   toilet )    is   very   small .    you   almost   have   to   climb   over   the   toilet   to   get   to   the   tub .    opening   the   door   while   you   are   in   the   bathroom   is   an   adventure   since   the   toilet   does   not   allow   much   free   space   to   move   about .    the   sink   is   in   the   bedroom .    it   appears   as   the   newly   renovated   rooms   will   have   a   more   functional   bathroom .    supplies   were   adequate .    there   is   an   iron   and   ironing   board   in   the   room ,    there   is   a   hair   dryer   by   the   sink . air   conditioning   was   adequate ,    but   ran   nearly   constantly   and   was   a   bit   noisy .    the   small   kitchen   had   a   very   high   counter ,    but   included   a   nice   refrigerator ,    microwave   and   coffee   maker . the   tv   was   in   need   of   replacement .    viewing   selctions    ( the   free   ones )    were   pretty   limited .    there   is   a   tv   in   the   bedroom . internet   access   was   available   either   through   an   ethernet   cable    ( located   by   the   couch )    or   wireless .    there   is   a    $  9  .  9  5    charge   per    2  4    hours   for   use   of   the   internet    ( it   amazes   me   that   far   less   expensive   properties   offer   this   for   free )  .    the   wireless   connection   dropped - off   at   times ,    making   on - line   work   difficult   at   times . the   pool   was   very   nice .    landscaping   in   the   courtyard   was   enjoyable .    there   was   a   gazebo   with   misters   for   outdoor   functions . the   on - site   agave   grill   offered   a   wonderful   free   cooked - to - order   breakfast   every   morning .    lunch   selections   were   decent   though   a   bit   more   expensive   than   i   would   like   to   spend .    dinner   selections   were   expensive   and   mostly   of   a   southwest   cuisine .    you   can   order   off   the   lunch   menu .    other   than   breakfast ,    food   taste   and   attractiveness   was   only   fair .    every   dinner   plate   i   received   was   chipped    ( maybe   i   kept   getting   the   same   plate )  .    the   facility   offers   a   manager ' s   happy   hour   with   free   soda    /    pop   and   reduced   price   alcohol .    there   is   also   free   finger   food    /    snacks . there   are   laundry   machines   on - site ,    but   be   sure   you   have   a   supply   of   quarters    -  -    they   have   none   at   the   front   desk   and   the   bar   only   has   a   few . there   is   a   new   cvs   pharmacy   across   the   street   as   well   as   mexican   grocery   store    -  -    otherwise ,    you   need   to   walk   some   distance   to   find   anything   else .  .  . and   this   is   not   the   best   neighborhood .    taxis   don ' t   work   this   area .  .  . and   if   you   catch   a   cab   down   town ,    have   the   hotel   address   in   hand   since   most   cab   drivers   do   not   seem   to   know   where   this   place   is   located .    i   could   not   figure   out   the   metro   bus   system ,    but   doubt   i   would   have   used   it   anyway   in   this   area .    we   had   a   car    -  -    highly   recommended    ( with   a   gps )  . the   complimentary   van   service   to   and   from   the   airport   was   excellent   from   what   others   in   my   party   said . |0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
mediocre   by   expected   standards ,    and   in   the   midst   of   a   renovation   i   stayed   at   this   facility   while   attending   the   american   legion ' s   national   convention ;    this   was   the   property   to   which   our   delegation   was   assigned .    in   terms   of   what   i   would   expect   from   the   embassy   suites   brand ,    this   was   mediocre   to   disappointing .    the   property   itself   is   in   a   marginal / transitional   part   of   the   city ,    and   is   not   particularly   convenient   to   many   of   the   major   attractions   in   the   phoenix   area .    a   traveler   staying   here   would   definitely   need   a   car   to   get   around .    it   is   an   older   facility ,    though   would   have   much   promise   with   a   major   upgrade .    the   rooms   are   relatively   spacious ,    but   a   bit   spartan   and   worn .    the   entry   doors   were   marginally   secure .    the   walls   were   thin ,    so   any   external   noise   from   outside   or   in   adjacent   rooms   were   sometimes   quite   audible .    some   of   the   electrical   outlets   worked   part   of   the   time ,    or   not   at   all .    the   air   conditioning   was   spotty   at   times .    the   in - room   refrigerator   was   slow   in   chilling   stored   beverages   or   food   items .    the   bathroom   is   incredibly   small ;    you   very   nearly   had   to   step   over   the   toilet   to   get   into   the   shower / bathtub .    the   beds   were   small   and   rock - hard ,    which    -    combined   with   the   spotty   air   conditioning    -    could   make   restful   sleep   problematic .    the   televisions   were   old   and   in   poor   working   order ,    and   the   cable   system   was   even   worse ,    as   several   featured   channels   were   nothing   but   snow   depending   on   the   time   of   day ,    or   even   the   room   you   were   watching   in . general   cleanliness   of   the   facilities   was   so - so .    housekeeping   was   open   to   the   outside ,    and   cleaned   bath   towels   were   stacked   near   the   entry ,    which   almost   made   laundry   pointless .    laundry   facilities   were   also   outside ;    while   the   washer   and   dryer   units   were   relatively   clean ,    there   was   no   place   to   fold   or   stack .    additionally ,    quarters   were   virtually   a   precious   commodity   in   the   hotel ,    and    $  1  .  0  0    only   bought   you    2  0    minutes   of   drying   time .    housekeeping   services   were   ridiculously   slow   and   late - arriving .    it   was   not   uncommon   during   the   week ' s   stay   that   your   room   would   be   left   unserviced   until   as   late   as    4  :  3  0 pm .    on   average ,    housekeeping   would   not   arrive   until   about    3  :  3  0 pm .    my   two   or   three   experiences   with   the   front   desk   staff   were   generally   poor ;    they   did   not   seem   knowledgable   about   their   own   property   or   the   area ,    and   could   not   meet   my   requests    ( see   above   with   obtaining   quarters   for   laundry )  . the   saving   grace   to   this   property   was   the   agave   cafe ,    their   on - site   restaurant   and   bar .    the   staff   was   very   polite ,    friendly ,    and   responsive    -    even   in   busier   periods    -    and   the   food   selection   was   very   good   and   generous   in   portion   size .    lunch   and   dinner   prices   were   as   to   be   expected   for   hotels .    again ,    this   property   was   not   what   i   expected   from   what   i   knew   fo   the   embassy   suites   brand .    this   property   was   undergoing   a   renovation   during   my   stay ,    which   appeared   to   include   a   complete   rebuild   of   the   guest   suites .    if   they   do   an   extensive   renovation ,    there   is   some   promise   to   the   property ,    but   they   will   have   much   work   ahead   of   them   to   make   it   a   place   i   could   recommend   to   other   travelers . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
tired   property   in   fairness ,    the   property   appears   to   be   in   the   middle   of   some   work   so   perhaps   a   year   from   now   would   be   better   but   i   was   there   august    2  0  0  8  .  .  . the   property   is   worn ,    shabby   and   certainly   not   up   to   the   standard   of   other   embassy   suites   at   which   i   have   stayed .    the   front   desk   was   very   pleasant   and   check   in   no   problem   but   the   room   was   clearly   in   need   of   a   renovation .    all   rooms   are   exterior   corridor   opening   to   their   courtyard .    the   interior   wall   adjacent   to   the   corridor   is   painted   brick   and   doesnt   give   a   great   feel   rather   it   feels   like   a   cheap   attempt   to   hide   odd   construction .    the   furnishings   were   old ,    wallpaper   worn ,    bathroom   needed   cleaning   and   sprucing   up   etc   etc .    the   location   is   not ,    i   am   now   advised ,    in   a   very   secure   part   of   town . the   internet   connection    (  $  9  .  9  5    per   day )    is   via   a   ethernet   cable   which   never   worked   during   my   two   night   stay .    luckily ,    the   business   center   in   the   lobby   was   open   and   working . the   hotel   has   a   restaurant   on   its   fifth   floor   which   served   decent   food . overall ,    i   was   disappointed   with   the   quality   of   the   room   and   would   not   return   to   this   property . |0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
wonderful   stay   my   husband   and   i   booked   this   hotel   when   we   flew   to   phoenix   last   week   to   move   our   daughter   there .    we   flew   in   early   in   the   morning   and   by   the   time   we   checked   in   later   in   the   afternoon   we   knew   that   our   daughter   would   have   to   stay   the   night   with   us   because   she   couldn鈥檛   move   into   her   apartment   until   the   next   day   or   day   after   that .    i   told   the   woman   at   the   front   desk   and   thought   i鈥檇   have   to   spend   more   for   my   daughter   but   to   my   surprise ,    she   gave   us   a   lower   rate   than   the   one   i鈥檇   booked   which   was    $  7  5    per   night    [ i   understand   that   july / august   are   the   off   season   months   for   phoenix ,    thus   the   lower   rate ]  .    i   agree   with   a   few   of   the   reviewers   that   the   rooms   could   be   updated   some ,    but   ours   was   very   comfortable   for   the    3    nights   we   were   there   and   we   loved   the   accessibility   of   the   airport .    the   lobby   is   very   nice   and   the   business   center   was   easily   accessible   and   met   our   needs .    our   breakfast   each   morning   was   wonderful ,    one   of   the   best   embassy   suites   breakfasts   that   i鈥檝e   had .    my   one   major   complaint   was   that   they   charged    $  9  .  9  5    for   internet   access   in   the   rooms   for   a    2  4  - hour   period .    this   is   the   first   instance   of   paying   for   the   internet   that   i鈥檝e   encountered   in   any   of   the   hilton   properties .    i   was   the   only   one   of   the    3    of   us   who   used   the   pool   and   it   was   very   clean   and   actually   refreshing   despite   the   fact   that   the   temps   were   well   into   the    1  0  0 s   each   of   the    3    days .    all   in   all ,    i鈥檇   recommend   this   hotel   to   everyone .    the   location   of   the   hotel   isn鈥檛   in   the   best   of   areas   in   phoenix ,    but   everything   is   so   accessible   there   that   you   can   find   a   restaurant   a   few   blocks   north   in   a   matter   of   minutes   and   we   never   were   concerned   about   our   safety . |0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
don ' t   stay   here   i   stayed   here   a   couple   months   back   during   a   business   trip .    this   place   was   awful .    it   was   so   old   and   in   a   terrible   part   of   town .    and   the   service   was   terrible .    nobody   seemed   to   know   what   they   were   doing .    i   asked   to   speak   to   the   woman   at   the   front   desk ' s   manager   after   her   poor   customer   service   and   he   was   an   even   bigger   joke .    he   was   loud ,    rude   and   unhelpful .    next   time   i   have   the   pleasure   of   traveling   to   phoenix ,    i   won ' t   ruin   it   by   staying   here . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
not   bad ,    considering   location .    overall ,    not   a   bad   place   to   stay .    the   pool   was   nice   although   since   it   was    1  1  5    degrees   outside ,    i   only   used   it   after    1  0 pm .    room   was   clean   and   the   furnshings   were   up   to   date .    the   bar   restaurant   area   sits   above   everything   on   the   top   floor   overlooking   everything ,    so   that   was   kind   of   cool .    bartender   was   friendly   as   was   the   check   in /    front   desk   people .    careful   walking   over   to   the    7  /  1  1    across   the   way   late   at   night ,    as   the   neighborhood   borders   shady .  .  . but   not   total   ghetto . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

just   ok ,    not   a   stellar   experience   we   stayed   at   this   hotel   because   of   its '    location   to   the   airport .    overall   the   hotel   was   nice ,    although   the   rooms   were   somewhat   out   of   date .    the   lobby   was   very   nice ,    although   the   only   restrooms   were   located   upstairs .    the   courtyard   area   was   nice   in   april ,    when   the   weather   was   not   extreme .    we   had   problems   with   both   the   tv   and   the   internet   service .    the   air   conditioner   ran   the   entire   time   we   were   there ,    and   was   barely   doing   the   job .    it   was   only   in   the   mid    8  0  ' s ,    so   i   can   imagine   it   would   be   insufficient   if   it   would   have   been   really   hot .    the   bathroom   was   tiny ,    to   the   point   where   you   had   to   back   up   to   the   tub   to   even   shut   the   door .    the   sink   area   is   in   the   bedroom ,    so   it   is   impossible   for   one   to   sleep   if   the   other   one   has   to   get   up .    the   blackout   curtains   were   nice ,    and   actually   worked .    the   linens   needed   updating .    because   of   flight   differences ,    i   stayed   at   the   hotel   for   several   hours   after   my   husband ,    and   did   find   the   staff   very   friendly   and   the   shuttle   service   to   the   hotel   convenient   and   efficient . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

pleasant   hotel   with   big   roomy   rooms .  .  .    i   traveled   to   phoenix   on   business   in   february   and   stayed   at   the   embassy   suites   phoenix   airport   for   two   nights .    i   was   very   impressed   with   the   big   roomy   rooms .    i ' ve   never   stayed   in   an   embassy   suites   before ,    so   i   don ' t   know   if   they   are   all   like   this ,    but   it   had   a   front   room   with   a   bedroom   in   the   back ,    a   nice   desk   and   tv   out   front   and   a   separate   tv   and   table   in   the   bedroom .    it   just   seemed   very   classy   and   like   the   kind   of   place   you   could   actually   bear   staying   at   for   several   days   of   business   or   fun .    i   liked   the   big   central   courtyard   with   the   pool    ( though   i   didn ' t   use   the   pool )    and   the    2  4    hour   snack   shop   near   the   front   desk   was   useful .  .  .     :  )    perhaps   the   very   best   part   was   the   awesome   custom   cooked   free   breakfast   in   the   dining   room .    the   chef   there   takes   your   order   and   cooks   eggs / pancakes / sausage /    etc   to   your   liking   and   then   you   add   fruit   etc   and   your   off   to   a   great   start   for   the   day .  .  . problems :     ( just   a   couple )  1  )    the   line   at   breakfast   was   always   just   a   bit   too   long 2  )    they   charged   extra   for   internet   access    (  $  1  0  / day )  .    given   the   price   you   pay   for   the   room ,    you ' d   think   they   could   throw   in   the   internet   for   free . |0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
hot    , noisy ,    dirty   but   food   is   good   according   the   hotel ,    in   the   fall   season   the   air   conditioning   has   to   be   turned   off   to   be   ready   for   winter .    unfortunately   the   conference   participants   staying   in   the   hotel   were   not   informed   of   this   fact .    the   weather   was   in   the    8  0  ' s   during   the   day   and   our   room   was    8  5  +    at   night .    a   few   fans   were   given   out   but   the   only   window   in   our   suite   faced   the   busy   street   on   the   ground   floor   and   had   no   screen .    we   requested   a   room   change   but   were   told   none   were   available .    repeated   complaints   to   the   front   desk   resulted   in   several   free   meals   at   the   restaurant -    which   actually   was   very   good   and ,    oddly ,    airconditioned   unlike   the   rooms .    nothing   was   done   about   the   room   temperature   or   the   screens   or   the   fan   which   fell   out   of   the   open   window . a   month   after   our   stay   there   was   an   expose   on   good   morning   america   of   the   cleaning   practices   at   this   hotel .    they   showed   cleaning   staff   wiping   floors   with   used   towels   and   then   using   the   same   towels   to   clean   drinking   glasses .    it   wasn ' t   that   surprising   after   our   stay . |0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

bad   service ,    bad   facility ,    bad   stay   this   is   the   worst   embassy   i   have   stayed .    the   airport   shuttle   service   took   over    1    hour   and   three   calls   to   pick   me   up .    each   call   said   they   were   on   their   way   and   would   be   there   in    1  0    minutes   or   less .    the   hotel   is   only    5    minutes .    i   was   given   a   free   dinner   coupon   for   my   troubles ,    but   the   restaurant   was   not   very   good   either . the   hotel   is   old   and   should   be   sold   or   rebuilt .    i   asked   for   a   quiet   room ,    especially   since   loud   construction   was   going   on   in   the   courtyard   and   placed   in   a   room   next   to   a   busy   street   that   was   very   loud .    especially   with   the   cracks   in   the   sliding   glass   window   to   the   street .    after   trying   to   nap   before   a   meeting ,    i   gave   up   and   asked   to   move .    the   desk   person   informed   me   that   all   the   king   rooms   were   on   that   busy   side   and   placed   me   in   a   double   bed   room   that   was   quiet .    why   didn ' t   the   first   person   at   the   desk   tell   me   that   when   i   explained   being   sick   and   requested   a   quiet   room ? when   i   tried   to   use   the   internet   service ,    the   instructions   given   to   me   from   the   front   desk   were   wrong .    i   eventually   figured   out   the   correct   sign   on   myself   and   it   did   work .    i   would   never   recommend   anyone   stay   at   this   hotel .    the   marriott   a   block   closer   to   the   airport   is   much   nicer   for   just   a   little   more ! |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
embassy   suites   phoenix   on    4  4 th    -    wonderful   this   hotel   was   wonderful !    the   hotel   itself   is   beautiful ,    built   around   a   lovely   courtyard .    the   rooms   were   spacious   and   the   beds   were   incredibly   comfortable .    the   staff   went   above   and   beyond .    i   left   my   purse   in   the   courtyard ,    and   the   waiter   recognized   it   and   returned   it   to   me   before   i   even   realized   i ' d   left   it   behind .    the   staff   went   out   of   their   way   to   be   accommodating   and   helpful   and   pleasant .    the   food   in   the   restaurant   was   very   good .    the   fitness   room   was   in   excellent   condition   with    2    treadmills ,     2    ellipticals ,    one   stationery   bike ,    plenty   of   free   weights ,    and   lots   of   towels . there   were   some   minor   things   that   i   didn ' t   like    -  -    the   bathroom   in   my   suite   was   on   the   small   side ;    the   wifi   was   not   free   and   on   occasion   there   was   difficulty   connecting   from   the   meeting   rooms ;    there   were   no   public   restrooms   on   the    3 rd   floor   anywhere   near   the   ocotillo   conference   room   that   we   used   for   our   public   meeting    ( the   staff   had   to   open   a   guest   room   for   us   to   use   throughout   the   day )  ;    there   was   no   room   service   before    1  1    am .    however ,    these   were   generally   minor   issues . and   with   the   wifi ,    there   was   a   charge   to   room   option ,    which   meant   no   need   to   sign   in ,    make   up   a   password ,    no   need   to   enter   a   credit   card   number ,    etc .    i   would   definitely   stay   here   again   if   i   ever   get   back   to   phoenix . |0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0

sweltering   indoors   in   phoenix   i   don ' t   even   know   where   to   began .    i   have   stayed   in   over   twenty   embassy   suites   over   the   last   eleven   years .    first   of   all   we   booked   this   room   because   it   was   about   twenty   dollars   cheaper   than   the   other   hotels   in   the   chain .    i   was   a   little   nervous ,    but   i   had   never   stayed   at   a   bad   embassy .    the   web   site   doesn ' t   mention   this   but    8  0  %    of   the   rooms   are   outside   with   front   and   back   entrances   leading   to   the   outside .    on   this   particular   day   it   was    1  1  0    degrees   in   phoenix .    when   we   arrived   we   were   hot .    we   had   driven   for   two   twelve   hour   days   in   the   sun ,    and   just   wanted   to   relax .    we   checked   in ,    front   desk   staff   courteous .    gave   us   our   room   key   and   we   went   on   our   way .    first   thing   we   noticed   upon   walking   in   the   room   was   the   smell .    it   was   very   musty   and   the   room   was   a   comfortable    8  7    degrees .    the   air   was   completely   off .    so   we   turned   it   down   and   waited   for   it   to   cool   off .    not   so   lucky .    after   two   hours   the   room   was   only   down   to    7  7    degrees   and   it   wasn ' t   going   any   lower .    i   am   on   medication   and   am   supposed   to   watch   my   heat   exposure   and   i   was   already   way   too   hot .    then   i   saw   a   sign   that   said   you   have   to   pay   for   internet   and   local   calls .    also   not   on   their   website .    called   the   front   desk   to   complain .  .  . then   went   to   the   front   desk   to   inform   them   about   the   air .    they   said   they   would   send   maintenance   and   i   was   a   gold   member   so   the   internet   was   free .     3  0    more   minutes   pass .    i   make   another   call .    oh   they   haven ' t   been   there   yet ?    he   probably   doesn ' t   have   his   radio .    i ' ll   look   for   him .    can   i   speak   to   a   manager ?    oh   there ' s   not   one   on   the   property .    as   i   am   standing   over   a   letter   that   says   if   you   don ' t   rate   us   a   ten   call   the   manager   on   duty .    we   will   find   someone   and   give   you   a   call .    ok .  .  . twenty   more   minutes   pass   now   i   am   calling   the    1  -  8  0  0    hilton   number .    oh   and   by   the   way   the   internet   is   down .    or   isn ' t   strong   enough   to   reach   your   room .    temperature   is   still    7  6    degrees .    finally   an   hour   after   the   first   call   maintenance   shows   up .    meanwhile   hilton   honors   is   trying   to   get   me   in   another   hotel .    when   hilton   finally   reaches   the   manager   she   says   if   they   leave   they   still   have   to   pay .    by   the   way   this   was   also   after   asking   to   switch   rooms .    we   were   told   there   were   no   other   available   rooms .    finally   three   hours   after   checking   in   we   were   released   to   go   somewhere   else .    we   ended   up   in   a   beautiful   hotel ,    for   twenty   more   dollars   a   night .    i   do   not   believe   our   problem   would   have   been   resolved   so   quickly   if   we   had   not   been   hilton   honors   gold   members .    by   the   way   maintenance   took   the   cover   off   the   air   conditioner ,    took   it   apart   and   put   it   back   together   again   and   said   it   was   fixed .    temperature   upon   checking   out    7  6    degrees .    stay   away   if   you   can . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
forget   park      i   live   in   northern   arizona   about   two   hours   away   from   sky   harbor   airport , and   my   family   and   i   always   stay   in   a   hotel   the   night   before   a   flight .    i   have   stayed   in   many   airport   hotels   but   will   never   stay   here   again .    we   arrived   late   in   the   evening   and   signed   up   for   an   early   morning   shuttle   to   the   airport .    the   pool   was   about    1  0  0    degrees   and   offered   no   respite   from   the    1  1  5    degree   heat .    the   rooms   are   definately   dated   and   the   location   is   in   a   less   than   optimal   neighborhood .    the   breakfast   wasn ' t   bad ,    but   i ' ve   had   better   at   other   embassy   suites .    when   i   returned   one   week   later   at    2  :  0  0    on   a   saturday   afternoon   i   called   for   a   pickup .    i   was   told   that   no   shuttle   was   available   so   i   should   to   take   a   cab   to   the   hotel   and   they   would   reimburse   the   driver    $  1  6  .    when   the   cab   driver   asked   to   be   paid ,    they   refused   to   pay   him   and   i   was   stuck   with   the   bill !    they   said   they   had   no   record   of   my   stay ,    so   i   asked   the   manager ,    tamara   carter ,    if   she   wanted   to   see   my   receipt .    she   did ,    so   i   dug   through   my   luggage   and   produced   a   receipt   for   my    $  1  4  2    stay .    she   then   said   that   i   had   neglected   to   sign   in   when   i   arrived   the   week   before ,    so   she   couldn ' t   reimburse   me   for   the   cab   ride .    she   pointed   out   that   if   i   had   parked   at   the   airport ,    it   would   have   cost   me   a   lot   more   than    $  1  6  .    i   pointed   out   that   i   wouldn ' t   have   stayed   at   their   hotel   had   i   known   they   were   going   to   charge   me   for   the   transportation .    this   hotel   administration   is   obviously   trying   to   cut   expenses   by   not   paying   for   a   shuttle   and   sticking   it   to   the   hotel   guests .    i   have   never   found   myself   in   this   situation   despite   three   to   four   trips   to   sky   harbor   per   year   for   the   past   ten   years .    there   are   many   other   airport   hotels   in   phoenix .    avoid   this   one . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

little   fans   do   not   make   a   hotel   luxurious   we ' ve   stayed   in   many   embassy   suites   across   the   country   before ,    so   we   felt   fairly   confident   in   booking   a   suite   at   this   one .    there   was   a   bit   of   difficulty   getting   to   the   hotel   due   to   road   construction .    the   staff   was   helpful   at   check   in ,    though   they   directed   us   to   park   by   an   elevator   that   was   out   of   order .    fortunately ,    there   were   several   other   elevators .    the   outside   of   the   building   was   lovely ,    as   was   the   pool .    the   room ,    on   the   other   hand ,    was   not .    the   wall   in   the   living   room   behind   the   sofa   was   filthy !    the   furniture   was   very   dated   and   worn .    one   of   the   lampshades   had   several   holes   in   it .    my   teen   tossed   and   turned   all   night   on   the   torture   rack   of   the   sofa - bed .    everywhere   you   looked ,    there   was   a   little   pleated   fan    -    on   ice   bucket   liner ,    the   paper   towel   rack ,    even   on   the   toilet   paper .    i   hate   to   break   it   the   management ,    but   a   little   fan   does   not   make   it   a   desirable   luxurious   room .    we   were   exhausted   from   our   travels ,    so   we   decided   to   try   the   restaurant   on   the   property   for   dinner .    that   was   a   huge   mistake .    my   asian   chicken   salad   came   with   tomatoes ,    which   the   wait   staff   assured   me   was   really   bell   peppers .    it   wasn ' t .    the   other   food   had   equally   odd   flavors .    the   cooked   to   order   breakfast   the   next   morning   was   very   nice ,    though   there   was   quite   a   long   line . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

value   packed   embassy   suites   i   felt   that   the   embassy   suites   phoenix   airport   at    4  4 th   street   is   worth   the   hotel   for   the   price ,    as   a   person   gets   what   they   pay   for .    the   complex   consists   of   a   four   story ,    courtyard   style   hotel   with   five   glass   elevators   and   five   sets   of   stairs .    the   hotel   has   security   gates   controlled   by   room   keys .    the   fitness   room   is   on   the   third   floor ,    and   the   agave   grill    ( onsite   restaurant )    is   located   on   the   north   end   of   the   facility .    some   portions   of   the   room   are   dated ,    like   the   flooring   in   the   bathroom   and   the   popcorn   ceiling ,    but   rooms   are   clean   and   spacious .    the   kitchenette   and   bathroom   sink   are   made   of   high   quality   granite .    the   kitchenette   also   has   a   microwave ,    mini   refrigerator ,    bar   sink ,    coffee   maker   and   four   sets   of   coffee   mugs   and   glasses .    the   two   room   suite   has   a   work   desk   with   telephone   and   task   chair ,    sofa   sleeper    ( we   did   not   use   this )  ,    chair ,    and   tv .    the   second   room   with   the   bed   has   a   bureau   that   doubles   as   a   tv   cabinet   and   clothing   storage   with   ironing   board . staff   at   the   hotel ,    from   the   front   desk ,    management ,    restaurant   personnel ,    and   maid   service   were   outstanding .    i   felt   the   hotel   was   well   maintained .    my   husband ,    who   loves   the   room   temperature   at   freezing   levels ,    was   not   pleased   with   the   air   conditioning   because   he   felt   the   air   was   not   cold   enough . the   hot ,    cooked   to   serve   breakfast   was   outstanding ,    and   so   is   the   nightly   manager ' s   receptiion   at   the   agave   grill    ( no   cost )  . with   regard   to   comments   of   those   fearful   of   the   neighborhood    .     .     .    i   walked   across   the   street   to   a   grocery   store   named   food   city .    i   would   consider   this   a   more   ethnic   oriented   area .    a   person   who   is   not   used   to   being   around   people   who   are   financially   challenged   may   be   afraid .    however ,    a   crime   can   happen   anywhere    -    rich   or   poor   neighborhood .    each   person   would   have   to   make   an   individual   call   on   the   neighborhood . overall ,    i   felt   our   stay   was   enjoyable   and   certainly   in   line   with   what   we   paid . |0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
good   for   short   stays   or   business   i   stayed   here   for   four   days   and   three   nights   on   a   business   trip .    when   i   first   arrived   i   was   given   a   room   next   to   the   elevator   on   the    2 nd   floor .    when   i   made   the   reservations   it   was   for   a   fourth   floor   room   by   the   pool .    when   i   realized   where   my   room   was   i   went   back   down   the   desk   and   requested   a   new   room .    that   request   was   granted   however   still   on   the    2 nd   floor .    however ,    the   room   was   wonderful .    i   had   no   complaints   about   the   room   or   the   service   at   all .    the   entire   hotel   stall   was   wonderful   and   very   accomodating .    our   meetings   were   held   at   the   hotel   also   and   they   were   very   nicely   handled   and   the   food   we   were   served   was   wonderul   also .    the   hotel   was   completely   booked   the   entire   time   that   our   party   but   you   would   have   never   known   it .    the   pool   was   relaxing   and   well   maintained .    they   would   even   leave   the   pool   open   later   then   normal   since   most   of   the   guests   were   in   meetings   and   dinner   parties   so   when   we   got   back   to   relax   it   was   nice   that   we   could   have   some   pool   time .    the   breakfasts   were   wonderful   and   the   cook   was   funny   and   a   great   start   for   the   day .    the   cocktain   reception   was   fun   and   a   great   place   to   meet   the   other   guests   that   were   there .    the   room   was   kept   clean   and   like   i   said   before   there   were   no   complaints .    however   if   you   are   wanting   to   walk   at   all   around   the   outside   of   the   hotel   area   i   wouldnt   recommend   it ,    as   well   at   the   staff   not   recommending   it .    its   not   a   great   area   of   phx   to   be   out   alone   walking ,    even   in   the   daytime   as   far   as   i   was   concerned .    however   i   did   it   one   time   in   the   daytime   but   was   scared .    you   can   hear   other   guests   shower   and   toilet   going   when   they   were   being   used   so   that   was   noisey .    but   that ' s   in   most   hotels   i   guess .    for   a   one   night   stay   it   would   be   great ,    however   for   extended   stay   and   something   super   special   you   should   stay   somewhere   else   perhaps .    other   then   that   i   have   nothing   really   bad   to   say . |0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
enjoyed   the   embassy   suites   i   was   a   little   nervous   staying   at   this   embassy   suites   after   reading   some   of   the   reviews ,    but   was   pleasantly   surprised .    i   just   returned   home   after   staying   there   two   nights .    first ,    i   found   the   staff   to   be   outstanding .    everyone   was   very   friendly   and   went   out   of   there   way   to   help .    second ,    the   rooms   were   quite   nice .    they   were   very   spacious   and   the   bed   was   comfortable .    while   this   hotel   is   not   really   near   anything   except   for   the   airport ,    i   didn ' t   mind   since   my   meeting   was   at   the   hotel .    i   would   recommend   this   hotel   for   someone   who   doesn ' t   mind   location .    it   definitely   exceeded   my   expectations . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
ok   for   an   overnight   stay   just   returned   from   a   one   night   stay   here . upside :    close   to   airport ;    front   desk   and   restaurant   staff   were   helpful ;    close   to   heard   museum   and   desert   botanical   gardens   and   chinese   cultural   center ; downside :     -    rooms   were   not   in   the   greatest   of   conditions ;    friday   evening   around    6  :  0  0    we   arrived   to   a   lot   of   people   around   the   courtyard   drinking   and   being   quite   loud ;    there   was   a   big   line   up   for   the   hot   food   area   at   breakfast   time   so   if   you   have   an   early   plane   to   catch    -    get   to   the   breakfast   area   early ;    if   i   were   returning   again ,    i   would   probably   try   another   hotel   close   to   the   airport . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
would   happily   stay   here   again .    we   spent   eight   of   the   past   nine   nights    ( march    1  0     -     1  8  ) at   this   hotel ,    and   had   no   problem   with   it .    breakfast   was   good ,    the   pool   very   appealing ,    and   the   complimentary   happy   hour   jovial .    service   was   cheerful   and   friendly    -    both   room   service   and   restaurant .    the   location   is   quite   central   in   far - flung   phoenix ,    and   handy   to   the   airport   and   freeways .    there ' s   a   good   grocery   store   a   couple   of   blocks   away ,    and   the   hotel   provides   barbecues   and   dishes   if   you   want   to   dine   in .    a   room   on   the   east   side   will   be   quieter   than   the   west ;    some   people   using   the   parking   lot   after   hours   can   be   noisy . |0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
would   not   stay   here   again   i   have   stayed   at   many   embassy   suites ,    and   this   is   the   first   one   that   has   disappointed   me .    we   stayed   in   room    3  1  5  .    it   was   march   and   the   weather   outside   was   a   little   cooler   than   normal ,    but   the   room   inside   was   still   warm .    i   tried   to   turn   on   the   air   conditioning ,    but   it   would   not   work .    i   called   the   front   desk .    the   man   told   me   that   they   were   in   neutral   mode   which   meant   that   none   of   the   rooms   got   air   conditioning   that   day .    he   told   me   to   open   the   balcony   door   to   let   in   cool   air .    at    5  :  0  0    pm ,    all   it   let   in   was   the   hot   afternoon   sun   with   no   breeze .    also ,    my   room   balcony   faced   a   very   busy   street ,    so   it   was   very   noisy .    plus ,    there   was   no   screen   on   the   door .    the   next   day   it   was   supposed   to   be   much   warmer   outside ,    so   i   asked   the   man   if   they   would   turn   on   the   a / c   tomorrow .    he   said   no .    the   room   was   a   little   outdated .    the   modem   port   was   on   the   end   table   next   to   the   couch ,    not   at   the   dining   table / desk ,    which   made   working   there   on   your   computer   almost   impossible .    the   bathroom   only   contained   the   toilet   and   shower ;    the   sink   area   is   right   in   the   bedroom .    the   sleeper   sofa   was   not   comfortable   at   all ;    do   not   plan   to   have   anyone   sleep   on   it .    the   balcony   was   barely   big   enough   to   hold   one   person . the   hotel   is   not   in   a   very   good   area ,    although   it   is   convenient   to   highways   and   the   airport .    i   would   not   stay   at   this   hotel   again . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
