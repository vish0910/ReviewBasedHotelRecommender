fabulous   hotel   my   husband   and   i   just   spent    6    nights   in   this   hotel   and   loved   every   minute .    the   staff   is   friendly   and   efficient .    we   stayed   for    4    nights ,    left   to   go   to   victoria   bc ,    then   came   back   for    2    more   nights .    the   hotel   has   old   world   charm .    the   room   decor   is   very   well   done    -    down   to   the   drapery ,    carpet   and   nice   artwork   on   the   walls .    the   bathrooms   are   modern   and   nicely   sized .    the   beds   were   very   comfortable .    the   rooms   and   bathrooms   were   spotless .    the   linens   were   fresh   and   spotless   as   well .    the   fresh   fruit   and   free   bottled   water   was   a   nice   touch   and   very   much   appreciated .    the   breakfast   room   was   clean   and   always   stocked   with   the   daily   offerings .    the   coffee   was   good   and   the   waffles   were   addicting .    even   the   elevator   was   fast   and   roomy .    you   don ' t   realize   how   much   you   appreciate   that   until   you   go   to   another   hotel   where   the   elevators   are   sloooooow   and   tiny    ( as   they   were   in   our   victoria   bc   hotel )  .    the   pioneer   square   area   is   lively   and   exciting   with   lots   of   little   shops   and   restaurants .    we   walked   around   the   area   at   night   and   didn ' t   feel   unsafe .    other   people   mentioned   street   people   as   problematic .    this   is   a   fact   of   life   in   any   large   city ,    but   none   of   the   street   people   were   aggressive   or   abusive .    just   a   block   away ,    they   offer   a   tour   of   seattle   underground   which   was   interesting .    pizza   at   mario ' s   was   delicious .    dinner   at   elliott ' s   oyster   house   at   pier    5  6    was   wonderful .    we   found   seattle   to   be   a   great   city   with   friendly   people   who   are   helpful   and   polite   to   tourists .    we   hope   to   visit   again   some   day   and   when   we   do ,    we   will   again   stay   at   the   best   western   pioneer   square   hotel . |0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0
very   disapointed   my   first   time   to   the   west   coast   and   i   had   to   pick   this   property ?    very   average   all   the   way   the   way !    the   noise   level   at   night   from   my   neighbors   was   way   too   loud .    the   service   was   slow   and   the   room   had   a   funny   smell .    the   staff   made   me   feel   like   an   unwelcome   visitor   not   a   special   guest .    no   wifi   service   although   they   advertise   there   is ?    this   not   a   good   best   western    -    to   bad   seatle   is   very   nice . ab|0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

ok   hotel   in   a   bad   location   the   hotel   is   not   terrible   in   itself ,    but   the   looming   and   noisy   i -  5    viaduct   is   nearby .    also ,    the   king   co .    courthouse   is   not   far ,    and   there   are   a   lot   of   people   who   hang   out   around   there   and   around   this   whole   area   who   are   not   the   greatest .    there   are   some   nice   tourist   destinations   near   this   hotel ,    but   you ' re   much   better   off   staying   nearer   the   convention   center   and   only   visiting   the   pioneer   square   area   in   daylight   if   there   are   specific   things   there   you   want   to   see .    near   the   convention   center   puts   you   closer   to   other   places   in   the   downtown   area   like   the   pike   st .    market . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

very   good   stay   we   spent   the   first   night   of   our   pacific   northwest / northern   ca   trip   at   the   pioneer   square   and   were   very   happy .    the   first   room   we   were   shown   had   a   slightly   odd   arrangement   where   the   tv   was   to   the   side   of   the   bed   and   not   easily   viewable .    being   from   boston   and   on   the   road   for   the   first   night   of   the   world   series ,    being   able   to   view   the   tv   was   important   to   us .    at   the   front   desk   my   request   was   easily   and   politely   accomodated   and   we   were   given   a   more   tv   viewable   room . we   found   the   location   of   the   hotel ,    particularly   with   the   free   public   transport   offered   by   seattle   to   be   great .    the   staff   was   very   professional   and   helpful .    the   only   slight   negative   was   the   breakfast   which   we   found   to   be   pretty   mediocre .    overall ,    we   were   very   happy   with   our   hotel   selection . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

very   convenient   location ;    highly   recommend .    my   husband   and   i   spent   a   week   in   seattle ,    basically   did   a   sightseeing / pub   crawl   tour   of   the   city .    this   hotel   is   the   only   one   in   pioneer   square ,    and   it   is   within   walking   distance   of   everything .    in   fact ,    it ' s   across   the   street   from   the   waterfront ,    which   is   a   popular   place   to   go   walking   and   sightseeing .    we   never   rented   a   car   or   taxi ;    didn ' t   need   one .    granted ,    we   walked   about    3  -  5    miles   a   day ,    but   stopped   anywhere   we   wanted   along   the   way .    you   don ' t   need   a   car   in   the   city ,    and   you   have   to   call   for   taxis   anyway .  .  . why   not   walk ? the   room   was   always   clean ,    and   a   decent   size   for   the   two   of   us .    it   had   a   weird   smell   though ,    but   it   wasn ' t   something   we   couldn ' t   tolerate ,    though .    it   is   very   charming   and   cozy ,    and   is   within   a   few   yards   of   great   restaurants   and   bars .    in   fact ,    out   of   all   the   meals   we   ate ,    the   restaurant   next   door ,    al   boccalino ' s ,    was   the   best .    they   provide   room   service   for   the   hotel ,    and   they   have   some   of   the   best   italian   food   i ' ve   ever   had .    somewhat   pricey ,    but   it   was   so   good .    hotel   staff   were   friendly ,    but   not   the   most   knowledgeable   of   all   the   questions   i   asked    ( such   as ,    can   they   help   with   reservations   for   the   victoria   clipper ,    what   bus    #    do   we   take   to   go   to   ballard ,    etc .  )  .    but ,    they   were   very   nice   and   always   tried   to   help . the   hotel   was   quiet   when   we   were   there ,    even   though   it   seemed   to   be   very   crowded .    i   would   recommend   it   to   anyone .    with   our   aaa   membership ,    we   paid    $  1  6  1    a   night ,    except   for   friday   night ,    which   was   more   expensive . |0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0
one   night   was   not   enough   trust   me ,    you   will   not   be   disappointed   if   you   stay   at   this   hotel .    what   can   i   say   about   the   best   western   pioneer   square   hotel   that   hasn ' t   already   been   said ?    from   the   welcome   to   seattle   from   the   girls   at   reception   to   the   have   a   good   trip   from   the   bell   captain ,    this   hotel   gets   my   vote   for   being   the   best . at   the   end   of   a   long   tiring   day   having   travelled   by   plane   and   boat   to   reach   seattle ,    all   my   cares   disappeared   as   soon   as   i   opened   the   door   to   my   hotel   room .    the   large   room   was   beautifully   decorated   with   the   king   size   bed   taking   pride   of   place .    it   looked   so   peaceful   and   welcoming   with   the   period   furniture   and   matching   appointments   that   i   couldn ' t   wait   to   unpack   and   relax   with   a   cup   of   tea .    the   lighting   was   excellent   with   not   a    4  0    watt   bulb   evident .    the   towels   were   plentiful   and   fluffy   and   there   was   loads   of   room   in   the   bathroom   to   lay   out   my   toiletries .    i   thought   the   framed   picture   on   the   wall   was   a   nice   homey   touch .    the   room   was   quiet   and   there   was   no   noise   to   disturb   a   dreamless   sleep   that   night .    in   fact ,    i   was   glad   the   next   morning   i   had   set   my   alarm   the   night   before . i   enjoyed   my   continental   breakfast   the   next   morning   of   toast ,    jam ,    yoghurt ,    fruit   and   coffee .    there   was   also   cold   cereals ,    danish   and   muffins   on   offer .    i   learned   that   bus   transportation   is   free   in   the   pioneer   square   area   and   the   bus   stop   is   just   steps   away   from   the   hotel   entrance   on   yesler .    however ,    since   i   wanted   to   explore   on   foot   it   was   an   easy   walk   to   the   uwajimaya   shopping   complex   in   chinatown    -    a   delightful   place .    although   my   room   rate   was   a   little   more   than   i   normally   pay ,    in   retrospect   my   one   night ' s   stay   was   worth   every   cent   and   i   fully   intend   to   make   a   return   visit   in   the   future . |0.0	2.0	0.0	0.0

an   okay   stay   in   seattle   when   every   other   hotel   is   booked   this   historic   hotel   has   been   remodeled   with   the   budget   traveller   in   mind .    we   had   a   corner   room ,    right   next   to   the   big   outdoor   hotel   neon   sign .    luckily ,    it   did   not   blink   all   night ;    a   couple   of   paper   clips   on   the   blackout   curtains   took   care   of   that   problem .    the   room   was   big   and   clean .    the   heating   unit   was   a   bit   quirky   with   its   remote   control ,    and   maintaining   a   comfortable   temperature   was   a   challenge .    it   was   cycled   between   either   a   bit   too   cool   and   a   bit   too   hot .    but   the   room   and   bath   were   clean   and   the   bathroom   fixtures   were   all   new   and   flawless .    bring   a    1  0  0    watt   bulb   if   you   want   to   read   in   bed    ( or   open   the   curtain   if   you   don ' t   mind   a   pink   hue )  .    the   biggest   downside   was   the   thin   wall   to   the   next   room   and   some   loud   guests .    for   the   price ,    its   about   the   quality   you   would   expect . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
no   security   in   pioneer   square   we   had   a   nice   stay   in   seattle   for   two   days   in   this   hotel ,    until   the   moment   we   were   checking   out .    we   had   noticed   what   appeared   to   be   vagrants   sitting   in   the   unattended   lobby   a   couple   of   times ,    including   the   early   morning   were   checking   out .    my   wife   left   our   bags   for   a   moment   to   get   a   muffin   at   the   continental   breakfast   and   when   she   came   back   to   the   bags ,    her   handbag   was   gone ,    and   so   was   the   fellow   who   was   sitting   across   from   her .    i   was   at   the   counter   checking   out   and   didn ' t   see   anything ,    but   i   did   see   the   suspicious   fellow   sitting   in   the   lobby   as   i   move   our   bags .    the   manager   was   not   there ,    as   it   was   a   sunday ,    and   they   have   treated   us   like   we ' re   trying   to   pull   a   scam .    they   claim   no   liability   for   baggage   untended ,    but   they   should   at   least   take   responsibility   for   making   sure   their   lobby   is   clear   of   derelicts   waiting   to   prey   on   their   customers .    from   about    9    a . m .    to    6    p . m .    there   is   supposed   to   be   someone   at   the   front   door ,    but   outside   those   hours   they   have   nobody   there ,    and   the   clerks   are   unable   to   see   who   is   coming   in   or   leaving .    the   manager   says   they   have   security   cameras ,    but   i   think   she   was   bluffing   to   see   if   i   backed   off   of   our   claims .    none   of   the   other   employees   there   that   morning   knew   of   any   cameras .    furthermore ,    the   manager   never   returned   any   of   my   calls   as   promised . we   feel   we ' ve   been   treated   disrespectfully ,    and   none   of   our   suggestions   have   been   taken   seriously    ( ie   the   need   for   full - time   front - door   concierge / security )  .    that   part   of   seattle   has   really   become   full   of   vagrants .    beware !  ! |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

just   fine .    this   hotel   is   located   in   pioneer   square ,    though   just   a   quick   walk   to   the   water   front / pike ' s   market .    however ,    the   immediate   location   is   a   bit   rough   around   the   edges   and   there   is   a   very   apparent   homeless   population .    once   you ' ve   walked   several   blocks   away   towards   the   market ,    it   gets   noticeably   better .    the   hotel   is   very   nice    -  -    our   room   was   spacious   and   nicely   decorated .    there   was   a   very   toxic   cleaning   agent   odor   that   required   us   to   open   the   windows   and   leave   them   open .    otherwise ,    it   was   a   nice   big   room   with   a   good   sized   bathroom .    breakfast   was   great .    it   is   served   in   an   adjoining   breakfast   room / cafe   to   the   hotel   and   includes   cereal ,    pastries ,    bagels   and   then   some .    above   and   beyond   most   continental   included   breakfasts .    the   parking   is   about    1     1  /  2    blocks   away   and   costs    $  1  8    a   day .    it ' s   relatively   convenient ,    though   when   we   returned   back   to   the   lot   around    9    or    1  0    pm   after   attending   a   wedding ,    it   was   sketchy .    there   were   a   few   shady   characters   lingering   around   the   garage    ( it ' s   locked   and   requires   access ,    but   once   your   key   card   opens   the   door ,    anyone   can   cruise   in   after   you .  )    all   in   all ,    it ' s   a   convenient   decent   place   for   a   reasonable   price .    if   you ' re   looking   for   luxury ,    this   isn ' t   it ,    but   it ' s   more   than   adequate . |0.0	3.0	0.0	0.0

great   hotel      i   had   planned   a   two - night   stay   for   early   october   in   the   best   western   pioneer   square   hotel   after   a   train   ride   from   la   to   seattle .    after   my   first   night    ( and   seeing   how   much   there   was   to   do   within   walking   distance )  ,    i   added   a   third   night . this   is   not   your   typical   best   western .    it   is   in   a   beautiful   c .  1  9  1  3    building .    the   hotel   is   modern   inside   with   wireless   internet   access ,    while   retaining   the   charm   with   huge   doors ,    beautiful   woodwork ,    and   high   ceilings .    it   was   absolutely   spotless ,    and   the   staff   was   very   friendly   and   helpful .    having   read   many   reviews ,    i   know   to   expect   no   free   parking    ( not   an   issue   as   i   didn ' t   have   a   rental )  ;    and   that   the   rooms   could   have   been   on   the   smallish   side .    mine   was   certainly   adequate ,    with   a   larger - than - average   bathroom .    my   window   was   on   an   airshaft ,    but   as   i   chose   the   lowest   priced   room ,    i   expected   that   too .    as   i   use   a   hotel   room   to   sleep   in ,    not   view   scenery   from ,    i   had   no   issue   with   it .    i   did   hear   someone   complaining   one   morning   about   highway   noise   as   their   room   was   on   that   side ,    so   i   was   glad   to   have   my   quiet   brick   wall ! they   offer   a   continental   breakfast   that   is   above   average .    there   is   a   separate   room   off   of   the   lobby   with   numerous   tables ,    complimentary   newspapers ,    and   a   staff   of   two   to   keep   things   clean      filled .    seattle   is   a   very   pc   city ,    and   yes ,    there   are   a   lot   of   homeless   found   on   the   streets .    but   not   one   bothered   me ,    and   i   had   no   concerns   about   walking   to   restaurants   at   night ,    alone .    the   streets   are   filled   with   people   until   quite   late ,    as   it   is   a   very   vibrant   area .    but   it   is   not   rowdy   by   any   means .    i   would   recommend   this   hotel   to   any   of   my   family   or   friends .    you   are   a   block   from   the   waterfront      ferries ;    pike   place   market   and   the   monorail   station   are   within   easy   walking   distance .    taxis   in   seattle   are   very   reasonably   priced   and   easy   to   find ,    and   there   is   free   city   bus   transport .    within   a   few   blocks   of   the   hotel ,    you   have   every   kind   of   restaurant   you   could   desire ,    many   antique   and   art   shops .    if   i   ever   return   to   seattle ,    i   know   i   will   stay   at   the   pioneer   square   hotel . s . murphynh|0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0
what   a   great   hotel !    don ' t   understand   the   complaints   on   this   website   about   this   hotel .    we   stayed   here   for   two   nights   in   late   august   and   loved   everything   about   it .    first ,    the   location   was   great .    it   was   within   walking   distance   of   both   the   waterfront   and   pike   place   market ,    and   we   could   easily   take   the   monorail   to   the   space   needle .     ( there   are   hills   in   seattle ,    so   if   you   have   someone   with   you   who   has   trouble   walking ,    you   may   want   to   consider   taking   a   bus   or   taxi .  )    both   the   lobby   and   the   room   were   nicely   decorated ,    and   the   staff   was   very   helpful .    being   on   pioneer   square   meant   that   we   could   go   next   door   or   right   across   the   street   to   get   a   drink   and / or   something   to   eat .    of   course ,    we   didn ' t   walk   through   the   square   at   night   because   of   the   street   people   who   hung   out   there ,    but   that ' s   just   common   sense .    we   were   never   bothered   by   anyone ,    and   because   this   hotel   is   so   well   located   we   were   able   to   easily   enjoy   this   great   city .    if   you ' re   worried   about   street   noise ,    call   the   hotel   directly   and   ask   for   an   interior   room .    we   had   an   interior   king   and   it   was   very   quiet .    we   plan   to   return   to   seattle ,    and   when   we   do ,    we ' ll   stay   at   the   best   western   pioneer   square   hotel   again . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

lack   of   customer   service   skills   and   overpriced   we   found   this   place   online   and   made   a   reservation   through   third   party   booking ,    like   many .    we   were   just   staying   one   night   and   sharing   the   room   with   friends .    when   we   arrived   we   were   politely   greeted .    our   reservation   was   for    4    persons   per   our   confirmation   letter .    when   they   asked   how   many   guests ,    we   told   them    4    and   they   said   that   the   extra   guest   cost   was    $  2  0  .  0  0    for   each   person   per   night .    our   rate   was   already   over    $  1  5  0  .  0  0    for   a   room   with    2    double   beds .    we   told   them   that   our   reservation   was   for    4    persons   and   they   said   their   system   said    2    persons .    we   went   ahead   and   took   the   room .    at   this   time   nobody   told   us   anything   about   parking   and   we   had   to   ask .    we   were   then   given   a   key   for   the   garage   and   told   it   would   be    $  5  0    if   we   lost   the   key   and    $  1  0  0    on   sunday   if   we   left   it   in   the   car   because   the   garage   is   closed   on   sundays .    nothing   more   was   said   about   parking .    we   left   and   went   to   the   ball   game   returning   late   in   the   evening .    we   received   our   keys   and   went   to   the   extremely   small   room .    we   walked   in   and   it   had   a   view   of   the   brick   building   next   door .    the   room   was   very   clean .    when   we   checked   out   the   next   morning   we   asked   again   about   the   rate   and   produced   the   confirmation   letter .    we   were   told   that   we   were   getting   the   best   rate   available   and   that   we   would   have   to   take   it   up   with   the   third   party   booking   company .    we   then   questioned   the   charge   for   the   parking .    we   were   never   told   about   the    $  1  8  .  0  0    to   park   in   the   garage .    we   told   them   such   and   were   told   he   was   the   manager   and   insisted   that   the   person   checking   us   in   told   us .    we   told   him   that   he   had   checked   us   in   and   that   he   only   told   us   about   the   key   charged   for   the   garage   and   never   the   parking   amount .    he   then   told   us   that   he   always   tells   guests   and   that   he   was   the   manager .    he   would   not   work   with   us   at   all   on   the   price   even   though   we   were   never   told   about   the   parking   fee   or   that   our   confirmation   letter   showed    4    persons .    so   in   turn   we   ended   up   paying    $  2  4  0  .  0  0    for   a   room   that   you   could   find   at   any   budget   motel .    the   breakfast   leaves   something   to   be   desired .    the   floor   was   filthy   with   food   and   the   food   was   not   well   stocked ,    counters   were   dirty   and   the   staff   was   sitting   behind   the   counter   talking .    we   walked   up   to   the   corner   tullys   instead . i   would   never   stay   at   this   motel   again .    having   worked   for   hotels   for   the   past    7    years ,    i   do   not   know   how   they   keep   guests .    if   we   treated   a   guest   as   they   had   we   would   be   out   of   business .    i   would   recommend   customer   service   training . we   will   never   stay   there   again   and   we   will   tell   many   people   about   our   experience .    this   is   definately   not   what   we   expected   from   a   best   western . we   gave   it   a    2    because   it   was   clean . |0.0	-2.0	0.0	0.0
the   customer   is   not   always   right   at   the   pioneer   square   it   was   a   sunday   night   in   april ,    and   we   were   in   town   for   a   concert ,    and   after   the   evening   crew   gave   a   great   effort ,    physically   showing   us   a   few   of   the   different   rooms    ( which   were   some   of   the   smallest   i ' ve   ever   seen ,    with   views   of   backend   brick   walls )  ,    they   led   us   to   believe   when   we   asked   about   parking   that   we   could   either   park   on   the   street   at   no   charge   that   night ,    or   park   in   the   garage   a   block   up   the   road .    when   we   were   thinking   about   getting   a   parking   pass   to   save   hassle   for   later ,    they   simply   said ,    talk   to   the   night   shift   when   you   get   back   and   they   will   set   you   up .    after   coming   back   that   night ,    a   young   man   was   working   who   claimed   he   was   new ,    and   got   his   manager   when   we   asked   about   the   parking .    when   we   asked   for   the   parking   pass ,    he   wanted    $  1  5    and   we   refused   telling   him   we   were   led   to   believe   by   the   conversation   with   the   evening   shift   that   it   was   free .    the   manager   told   us   that   that   wasn ' t   his   policy   as   he   pulled   out   his   hotel   policy   book   and   that   we   either   had   to   pay   the    $  1  5    or   park   on   the   street   which   started   on   the   meter   at    7    am .    this   was   great   news   coming   at    1    am   and   exhausted .    we   felt   cheated .       in   an   obvious   bluff   attempt   he   then   proceeded   to   tell   us   that   he   would   check   the   video   tape    ( as   he   told   us   everything   was   recorded   throughout   the   day )    and   if   we   weren ' t   told   about   the   charge   he   would   give   us   our   pass   at   no   charge .    when   i   accepted   the   offer   staring   him   in   the   face ,    he   then   proceeded   to   go   back   on   his   offer   and   again   refused   to   offer   the   pass   running   in   circles ,    you   mean   they   didn ' t   give   you   the   pass   yet ?    excuse   me ?  ?  ?    what ?    if   i   had   the   pass   already ,    i   would   have   been   in   a   parking   lot   parking   my   car ,    and   not   in   the   middle   of   an   argument   about   paying   it .    we   had   only   been   there   checked   in   hours   earlier   and   told   the   manager   that   we   wanted   our   money   back   and   would   go   find   another   hotel   in   that   case .    he   refused .    he   would   not   refund   us   our   money   and   we   were   forced   to   stay   there   that   night .    it   was   late ,    we   were   tired   and   he   was   running   in   circles   with   his   lame   arguments ,    we   decided   to   wake   up   at    7    am ,    pay   the   meter   for   a   couple   more   hours ,    and   leave .    i   wasn ' t   giving   this   place   another   dollar .    the   next   day   we   found   another   hotel   near   the   space   needle   and   were   treated   with   the   utmost   respect   and   in   subsequent   visits   will   never   stay   at   that   dive   again .    the   only   good   thing ,    and   the   reason   i   gave   a    2    and   not   a    1    was   the   one   bellhop   that   showed   us   the   small   rooms   and   helped   us   with   the   door   that   would   never   swipe   and   really   helped   us   out .    the   place   is   a   nice   location ,    but   based   on   this   experience ,    the   lack   of   management   skills ,    and   others   that   i   read   that   had   the   same   parking   problem ,    there   are   other   hotels ,    and   i   would   pass   on   the   pioneer   square   best   western . |0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
location   is   everything !    if   you   are   looking   for   the   perfect   location   to   stay   at   in   seattle ,    consider   the   best   western   hotel   in   pioneer   square .    also   called   the   pioneer   square   hotel ,    it ' s   located   just   off   of   the   square   in   downtown   seattle .    it ' s   only   a   block   away   from   the   waterfront   and   within   easy   walking   distance   of   both   safeco   field    ( for   baseball   fans )  ,    the   new   seahawks   football   stadium   and   pike   place   market . as   far   as   downtown   hotels   go ,    the   best   western   is   a   bargain   compared   to   most   hotels   of   this   caliber .    the   rooms   inside   the   hotel   were   of   a   decent   size    ( not   huge    -    but   not   tiny   either )    and   clean .    the   staff   was   very   friendly   and   helpful ,    and   along   with   the   location ,    they   were   the   highlight   of   the   hotel . the   only   negative   things   i   can   think   of   is   the   fact   that   you   do   have   to   pay   for   your   parking   and   that   the   complemetary   continental   breakfast   was   lacking   in   terms   of   selection   and   quality . having   said   that    -    a   clean   hotel   room   at   a   good   price   in   the   heart   of   seattle   is   a   heck   of   a   bargain .    i ' ll   be   back   again ! |0.0	-1.0	0.0	0.0
